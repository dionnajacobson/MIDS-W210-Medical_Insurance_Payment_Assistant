# Project Overview

### Dataset

The medical billing virtual assistant makes use of MIMIC-III dataset (1-4).  The description from physionet.org: "MIMIC-III is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012."

The data is a series of related tables that have anonymized patient data.  Using these tables, ICD-9 codes can be related to clinical note text.  The methodology for the creation of hte database is shown in the figure below (5).
